# Coreutils-Basem_Elgalfy

This repository is a Go implementation of some of the core utilities commonly found in Unix-like operating systems. The project aims to provide a learning platform for Go programming and an understanding of how these fundamental utilities work.

- `tail`: Output the last part of files, supports the -n flag
- `tree`: List contents of directories in a tree-like format, supports the -L flag
- `true`: Do nothing, successfully
- `wc`: Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file, supports the -w , -c and -l flags
